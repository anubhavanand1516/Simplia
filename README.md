# Homecare Leads Generator

A small Python toolkit to generate synthetic homecare industry leads, clean and deduplicate them, score and classify lead quality, export to CSV, and simulate phone scripts based on the lead quality.

### Features
- Generate realistic synthetic leads for NJ locations and common homecare verticals.
- Clean and dedupe leads by `email` and `phone`.
- Score and classify leads into High / Medium / Low quality.
- Save results to `homecare_leads.csv`.
- Simulate tailored call scripts per lead quality.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Orchestrates lead generation → cleaning/deduping → scoring → CSV export and prints summary.
- `lead_generator.py`: Creates synthetic lead records with demographics and intent indicators.
- `lead_cleaner.py`: Cleans fields and removes duplicates.
- `lead_scorer.py`: Computes a numeric score and assigns quality tiers.
- `call_simulator.py`: Loads the CSV and prints example call scripts for different lead qualities.
- `homecare_leads.csv`: Output file generated by `main.py` (overwritten on each run).
- `venv/`: Local virtual environment (optional).

## Quick Start

### 1) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/anubhavanand/Desktop/homecare_leads
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2) Install dependencies
This project uses only pandas (numpy is a transitive dependency).
```bash
pip install pandas
```

### 3) Generate leads and export CSV
```bash
python main.py
```
Output:
- Creates/overwrites `./homecare_leads.csv`.
- Prints:
  - Records before/after dedup.
  - Quality distribution.
  - Top 5 High-quality leads.

### 4) Simulate call scripts
Run after `homecare_leads.csv` exists:
```bash
python call_simulator.py
```

You’ll see example scripts for:
- 2 High-quality leads (Script A, direct booking).
- 1 Low-quality lead (Script B, nurture).
- 1 Medium-quality lead (Script C, follow-up).

## Data Model

Each lead record has:
- Identity: `contact_name`, `business_name`, `email`, `phone`
- Location: `city`, `county` (NJ cities/counties)
- Context: `industry`, `demographic_fit`
- Buying signals: `website_present` (bool), `budget_ready` (bool), `decision_maker_available` (bool), `purchase_timeline_days` (int)
- Metadata: `created_at` (ISO timestamp)
- Derived: `score` (int), `quality` (High/Medium/Low)

CSV columns are aligned with the above fields.

## Lead Generation Logic (`lead_generator.py`)
- Names and businesses are composed from small name lists and suffixes.
- Emails are derived from `contact_name` and business base; phones are US-like.
- Location randomly chosen from a curated NJ list.
- Signals (`website_present`, `budget_ready`, `decision_maker_available`, `purchase_timeline_days`, `demographic_fit`) are randomly sampled with sensible probabilities.
- Default: `generate_leads(num_records=25, seed=42)` for reproducibility.

Adjustable parameters:
- `num_records`: count of leads to generate.
- `seed`: RNG seed for reproducibility.
- Lists: `nj_locations`, `industries`, `target_demographics`, `first_names`, `last_names`.

## Cleaning & Deduping (`lead_cleaner.py`)
- Normalizes `email` to lowercase, trims whitespace on `email` and `phone`.
- Demonstrates deduping by intentionally duplicating the first row once.
- Drops duplicates on `['email','phone']` keeping the first occurrence.
- Returns `(df, before, after)` counts.

## Scoring & Classification (`lead_scorer.py`)
Score components:
- +30 if `budget_ready`
- +25 if `decision_maker_available`
- +20 if `purchase_timeline_days` ≤ 30; else +10 if ≤ 60
- +15 if `demographic_fit` in {"Seniors","Case Managers","Discharge Planners","Nurses","Caregivers"}
- +10 if `website_present`

Quality bands:
- `High` if score ≥ 70
- `Medium` if 40 ≤ score < 70
- `Low` if score < 40

Use `score_and_classify(df)` to append `score` and `quality`.

## Call Scripts (`call_simulator.py`)
Templates:
- Script A (High): Direct, decision-maker, schedule a 20-minute intake.
- Script B (Low): Light nurture, send PDF, follow-up next month.
- Script C (Medium): Follow-up addressing an objection (default: “budget approval”).

Use:
```python
get_script(quality, row, rep="Anand", company="Simplia", objection="budget approval")
```

## Typical Workflow
1) Run `python main.py` to generate and export leads.
2) Inspect the printed summary and `homecare_leads.csv`.
3) Run `python call_simulator.py` to see tailored call scripts.

## Customization Tips
- Change scoring thresholds or weights in `lead_scorer.py`.
- Modify industries, locations, or name pools in `lead_generator.py`.
- Add/adjust dedupe keys in `lead_cleaner.py` (e.g., include `business_name`).
- Tweak scripts or routing logic in `call_simulator.py`.

## Troubleshooting
- File not found when running `call_simulator.py`: Run `python main.py` first to create `homecare_leads.csv`.
- No High/Medium/Low examples printed: With small samples, some tiers might be empty; increase `num_records` in `main.py` or adjust scoring thresholds.
- Import errors: Ensure you’re in the project directory and the venv is activated.
